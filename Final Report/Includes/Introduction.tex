	\section{Introduction}
VLC is a Python-like high level language for GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) programming on Nvidia GPUs.\\

VLC is primarily intended for numerical computation, which can be performed orders of magnitude faster on parallelizable GPU architecture than on traditional x86 architecture. VLC is intended to provide convenient and safe access to the GPUâ€™s computational power by abstracting common lower level operations - for example, data transfer between the CPU and the GPU - from the user.\\

Other functionality provided by VLC include built-in higher order map and reduce functions that utilize the parallel capabilities of a GPU.	Dice is a general purpose, object-oriented programming language. The principal is simplicity, pulling many themes of the language from Java. Dice is a high level language that utilizes LLVM IR to abstract away hardware implementation of code. Utilizing the LLVM as a backend allows for automatic garbage collection of variables as well.
